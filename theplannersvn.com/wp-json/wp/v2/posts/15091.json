A staple in many classical string quartet repertoires, its beautiful, calming, gentle, and peaceful qualities are a perfect complement to any wedding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2.&nbsp;Ave Maria \u2013 Johann Sebastian Bach \/ Charels Gounod<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This delightful piece of music was chosen by my sister as she walked down the aisle of her outdoor wedding. Its lofty, dream like melody&nbsp;provides a picturesque scene of tranquility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3.&nbsp;Canon in D \u2013 Johann Pachelbel<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is another extremely popular piece of music played at weddings. It\u2019s an elegant piece of music with delicate simplicity, making it an ideal wedding song for the bride as she walks down the aisle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4.&nbsp;Ave Verum Corpus \u2013 Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though it may not be great for the professional, Mozart\u2019s&nbsp;<em>Ave Verum Corpus<\/em>&nbsp;makes a fantastic wedding song for the in-between parts of the wedding. Its angelic melodies and classic harmonies would easily set the tone of the ceremony.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5.&nbsp;\u201cWinter\u201d mvmt. 2 from the Four Seasons \u2013 Antonio Vivaldi<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the violin in&nbsp;Vivaldi\u2019s&nbsp;<em>Four Seasons<\/em>&nbsp;captures the ears of your guests, the bride will capture their eyes as she makes her way down the aisle. However, I think it would be better if the tempo of Winter\u2019s second movement was slightly slower than normal. There\u2019s no reason for the bride to rush to the alter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6.&nbsp;Procession of Nobles \u2013 Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s a song you don\u2019t hear at weddings. Perhaps, because it isn\u2019t widely known. The<em>Procession of Nobles<\/em>&nbsp;from Rimsky-Korsakov\u2019s opera&nbsp;<em>Mlada<\/em>&nbsp;would be an unusual, but fun way to end the wedding. Its regal fanfare presents the newly married couple to the world!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7.&nbsp;March of the Priests from The Magic Flute \u2013 Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cMarch of Priests\u201d would make a lovely wedding song as the groomsmen and bridesmaids process to the alter prior to the bride\u2019s entrance. Its calm and stately demeanor adds a touch of sophistication and regality to the ceremony.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>8.&nbsp;Marche troyenne, for orchestra from Les Troyens \u2013 Hector Berlioz<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s another song you could use for your wedding as your flower girl as well as the groomsmen and bridesmaids made make their way to the sides of the alter. If you\u2019re looking to have a unique wedding, you may want to give this song a try.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">MODERN WEDDING SONGS:<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1.\u201cMarry me\u201d \u2013 Train<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This rock group\u2019s 1st&nbsp;hit came more than 15yrs ago!&nbsp; And they\u2019re still going strong!&nbsp; Most popular for their rock tunes, one listen to the guitar on this romantic song complete with a pledge of love and marriage!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2.\u201cLa vien rose\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The song will never get old though it was released for years and years. It is a beautiful, romantic song and a great song choice for your slow first dance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhen you kiss me heaven sighs<br>And though I close my eyes<br>I see la vie en rose.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This song has many versions in French and in English and presented by both female and male singers.

Believe us, it will enhance your feeling!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3.\u201cA thoudsand years\u201d-Christina Perry<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re a Twilight movie fan, you already know how incredibly moving this song and its lyrics are; about finally allowing yourself to \u201cfall\u201d and embracing it.&nbsp; The innocence in her voice only adds to the beauty of this song<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4.\u201cCome away with me\u201d-Norah Jones<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mainstream and 11 years old, it still remains a popular romantic song and always makes any suggestion list!&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because if there\u2019s ever a song that can, in an instant, grab you and take you away to some secluded romantic and peaceful place!&nbsp; Oh, and she sings of taking her lover with her, hence the title \u201ccome away with me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5.All of me\u2013 John Legend<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cause all of me<br>Loves all of you<br>Love your curves and all your edges<br>All your perfect imperfections<br>Give your all to me<br>I\u2019ll give my all to you<br>You\u2019re my end and my beginning<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a beautiful song from the 6<sup>th<\/sup>&nbsp;album of John Legend. The meaningful lyrics can touch anyone heart and can be played at many moments in the wedding: when the bride walks down the aisle, after the ceremony or first dance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6.Love me like you do- Ellen Goulding<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cLove me like you do, love me like you do<br>Love me like you do, love me like you do<br>Touch me like you do, touch me like you do<br>What are you waiting for?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The catchy melody and easy-to-sing-along lyrics make the song be one of the most played songs in weddings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7.Photograph- Ed Sheeran&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul<br>And it\u2019s the only thing that I know, know<br>I swear it will get easier,<br>Remember that with every piece of you<br>Hm, and it\u2019s the only thing we take with us when we die2<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to love song, Ed Sheeran is the top of mind. He is a talented singer and writer. Any of his songs can be chosen to play at your wedding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>8. Thinking out loud \u2013 Ed Sheeran<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And darling I will be loving you \u2019til we\u2019re 70<br>And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23<br>And I\u2019m thinking \u2019bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways<br>Maybe just the touch of a hand<br>Oh me I fall in love with you every single day<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I just wanna tell you I am<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The beautiful lyrics along with the nice voice of Ed Sheeran has made Thinking Out Loud be one of the most favourite songs of many audiences.
